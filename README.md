## Overview and business use case

Retail price optimization is a data-driven approach used by retailers to determine the most optimal prices for their products or services. The goal is to set prices that strike the right balance between maximizing revenue, attracting customers, and ensuring profitability. This is achieved by analyzing various factors, including customer behavior, market trends, competition, and product demand. Electricity retailers face unique challenges, including volatile wholesale electricity prices, regulatory requirements, and the need to attract and retain customers. Optimizing retail electricity prices involves data analysis, demand forecasting, and understanding customer behavior to set competitive and profitable pricing strategies.
